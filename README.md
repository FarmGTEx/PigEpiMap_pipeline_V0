## 🌟 Overview

**PigEpiMap** is the first multi-tissue **epigenomic atlas** of the pig at a scale directly comparable to human flagship projects such as **Roadmap Epigenomics**, **EpiMap**, and **EN-TEx**.

This project systematically catalogs:
- **2,726** high-quality ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq profiles
- Across **50 tissues and cell types**
- From both male and female pigs
- Covering over **370,000 regulatory elements**, **730,000 enhancer-gene pairs**, and **46,000 allele-specific variants**

🔬 It enables **cross-species regulatory inference**, **GWAS variant interpretation**, and **deep learning-based sequence modeling** to predict human regulatory activity.

## 🧬 Key Features

- ✅ **Genome-wide regulatory annotation**: 72,566 promoters, 298,591 enhancers
- 🔁 **3D enhancer-gene interactions**: Anchored by chromatin interaction and co-accessibility
- 🧬 **Allele-specific regulation**: 46,386 high-confidence AS-SNPs across tissues
- 🤖 **Deep learning model**: DNABERT-2 trained on pig data predicts human AS variants
- 🔍 **GWAS interpretation**: e.g., schizophrenia, Crohn’s disease, BMI
- 🌍 **Comparative genomics**: Conserved TFs and sequence features across pig & human

---

## 🚀 Applications

### 🔬 Biomedical Research
- A **non-rodent reference** for human regulatory genomics
- Prioritization of noncoding variants in **human complex traits**
- Insights into **digestive and neurological systems** using pig tissues inaccessible in humans
- Supports **xenotransplantation research** (heart, liver, kidney)

### 🐖 Agricultural Genomics
- A foundation for **FarmGTEx**
- Enables **precision breeding**, genome editing
- Improves interpretation of **molecular QTLs (molQTLs)** in livestock
